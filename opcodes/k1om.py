    :ivar B: the MVEX.B bit. Possible values are None, or a reference to one of the instruction operands.

        None indicates that this bit is ignored. \
        If R is a reference to an instruction operand, the operand can be of register or memory type. If the operand is\
        of register type, the MVEX.R bit specifies the high bit (bit 3) of the register number, and the MVEX.X bit is \
        ignored. If the operand is of memory type, the MVEX.R bit specifies the high bit (bit 3) of the base register \
        number, and the X instance variable refers to the same operand.

    :ivar X: the MVEX.X bit. Possible values are None, or a reference to one of the instruction operands.

        The value None indicates that this bit is ignored. \
        If X is a reference to an instruction operand, the operand is of memory type and the MVEX.X bit specifies the \
        high bit (bit 3) of the index register number, and the B instance variable refers to the same operand.

    :ivar vvvv: the MVEX vvvv field. Possible values are 0b0000 or a reference to one of the instruction operands.

        The value 0b0000 indicates that this field is not used. \
        If vvvv is a reference to an instruction operand, the operand is of register type and MVEX.vvvv field \
        specifies the register number.

    :ivar V: the MVEX V field. Possible values are 0, or a reference to one of the instruction operands.

        The value 0 indicates that this field is not used (MVEX.vvvv is not used or encodes a general-purpose register).

    :ivar SSS: the MVEX SSS (swizzle/broadcast/up-convert/down-convert) field. Possible values are 0, or a reference \
    to one of the instruction operands.

        The value 0 indicates that this field is not used. \
        If SSS is a reference to an instruction operand, the operand type either includes a swizzle, broadcast, or \
        conversion primitive, or the operand type is {er} (static rounding control), or the operand type is {sae}. \
        If SSS is a reference to a memory/register operand, it encodes the primitive applied to the operand. \
        If SSS is a reference to a static rounding control operand, it the high bit of MVEX.SSS encodes \
        suppress-all-exceptions mode (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled) and the two low bits encode rounding mode (round \
        to nearest even = 0b00, round down = 0b01, round up = 0b10, round toward zero = 0b11) \
        If SSS is a reference to a suppress-all-exceptions operand, the high bit of MVEX.SSS encodes the \
        suppress-all-exceptions mode (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled) and the two low bits are ignored.

    :ivar aaa: the MVEX aaa (embedded opmask register specifier) field. Possible values are 0 or a reference to one of \
    the instruction operands.

        The value 0 indicates that this field is not used. \
        If aaa is a reference to an instruction operand, the operand supports register mask, and MVEX.aaa encodes the \
        mask register.

    :ivar E: the MVEX E (eviction hint/MVEX.SSS override) bit. Possible values are 0, 1, or a reference to an \
    instruction operand.

        The value 0 indicates that MVEX.SSS field specifies swizzle primitive for a register operand. \
        The value 1 indicates that MVEX.SSS field specifies static rounding mode and/or suppress-all-exceptions mode \
        for the instruction. \
        If E is a reference to an instruction operand, the operand is of memory type, and MVEX.E encodes whether \
        eviction hint applies to the operand (1 = eviction hint set, 0 = eviction hint not set).

    :ivar disp8xN: the N value used for encoding compressed 8-bit displacement of memory operands when no broadcast or \
    conversion is specified. Possible values are powers of 2 in [4, 64] range or None.

        None indicates that this instruction form does not use displacement (the form has no memory operands).

        When broadcast or conversion is specified, N is decreased by the following factors:

            {1to16}
                N is decreased by 16

            {4to16}
                N is decreased by 4

            {1to8}
                N is decreased by 8

            {4to8}
                N is decreased by 2

            {float16}
                N is decreased by 2

            {uint16}
                N is decreased by 2

            {sint16}
                N is decreased by 2

            {uint8}
                N is decreased by 4

            {sint8}
